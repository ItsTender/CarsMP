    <h2>     Chevrolet Corvette ZO6 </h2> <h4>

        The Chevrolet Corvette (C8) is the eighth generation of the Corvette sports car manufactured by American automobile manufacturer Chevrolet. It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model's introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. The racing version, the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R, also made its debut that same month. Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.
        Following several experimental CERV prototype vehicles, the C8 is GM's first production rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued. It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coil-over springs in place of leaf springs used on prior models. The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car. Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7. As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm). The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. A special Z button (a homage to Zora Arkus-Duntov "Father of the Corvette") is also mounted on the steering wheel; this can quickly activate customized performance settings.
        The performance version of the Corvette, the Z06, was unveiled on October 26, 2021. The Z06 entered production as a 2023 model year as a homologation vehicle. Trim levels and options The Z06 has three trim levels adding various interior comfort and technology upgrades: 1LZ, 2LZ, and 3LZ. Additionally, the Z07 Performance Package can be applied to any trim that adds improved brakes, carbon fiber aerodynamic elements, suspension tuning, and performance tires. 
        The Z06 uses a new naturally aspirated 5.5 L V8 producing 670 hp (500 kW; 679 PS) at 8,400 rpm, 460 lb⋅ft (624 N⋅m) of torque at 6,300 rpm and has a redline of 8,600 rpm. This engine, dubbed the LT6, features a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) and a flat-plane crank, and surpasses the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black Series' M159 engine to become the most powerful naturally aspirated production V8. A modified version of this engine has powered the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R since 2019, and many features in the racing engine carry over to the road engine. Other features of this new engine include a cast aluminum block, dual coil valve springs supporting titanium intake & sodium filled exhaust valves, forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, active split intake manifold with twin 87mm throttle bodies, four-into-two-into-one stainless steel exhaust headers, and a factory six-stage 10-quart dry sump oiling system with individual crank bay scavenging. A feature the LT6 shares with other Chevrolet small blocks is the bore spacing of 4.4 inches. The Z06 uses the same 8-speed dual-clutch transmission used by Stingray models, albeit with a shorter 5.56:1 final drive ratio for improved acceleration. Chevrolet claims this allows the Z06 to accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 2.6 seconds. The Z06 features the same basic suspension setup as the Stingray, however the electronic limited-slip differential and magnetic ride adaptive suspension system are now standard for all Z06 trims. The Z07 Performance Package includes the FE7 track-oriented suspension setup. The Z06's body has been widened to accommodate larger wheels and thicker tires. The wheels have diameters of 20 inches (51 cm) at the front and 21 inches (53 cm) at the rear, and are available with standard alloy or optional carbon fiber rims. The tires have dimensions of 275/30ZR20 at the front and 345/25ZR21 at the rear, and the Z07 Performance Package comes standard with Michelin Cup 2 R ZP performance tires. Chevrolet claims that the optional carbon fiber wheels, supplied by Australian manufacturer Carbon Revolution, shave off 41 lb (19 kg) of unsprung weight. The base Z06 comes with a front splitter and a rear spoiler. Under the splitter are stall gurneys to reduce drag. Included with the rear spoiler is an installable fixed Gurney flap, which when installed produces 365 lb (166 kg) pounds more downforce at 300 km/h (186 mph). The Z07 carbon fiber performance package adds a larger front-splitter, front corner canards (dive planes), a pedestal mounted rear wing, and underbody aero strakes, and removes the stall gurneys under the splitter for additional downforce. Chevrolet claims that with all these equipped and in the track configuration, the Z06 is capable of 1.22g lateral acceleration on a skidpad. Chevrolet claims a 10.6-second quarter-mile time for the Z06 model when equipped with the Z07 package. The C8 Z06 is able to reach top speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h).
