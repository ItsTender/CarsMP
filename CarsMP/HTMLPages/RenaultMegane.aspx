    <h2> Renault Megane RS Trophy </h2> <h4>
        The Renault Mégane Renault Sport (alternatively Renault Mégane RS) is a series of high-performance hatchback models based on the Renault Mégane, produced since 2004 by the high-performance subsidiary company Renault Sport for its parent company Alpine, a subsidiary of Renault. The Mégane RS won awards such as "Best hot hatch" from What car? (2010–2014), "Highest placed non-supercar" in Evo's annual Car of the Year test 2011 and "Best hot hatch" from Top Gear. The third generation of the Renault Megane R.S. is based on the 4th generation of the Mégane and was introduced at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is available in 3 trims: 280-Sport, 280-Cup and 300-Trophy. The Mégane R.S. is only available in 5-door hatchback bodystyle and was developed with the assistance of Renault F1 team driver Nico Hulkenberg.
        All feature a similar turbocharged 1.8-litre inline-4 engine (to a varying rate of tune) shared with the Alpine A110, and as standard a four-wheel steering system to improve handling, though this was removed to save weight in the Trophy-R. Five selectable drive-modes are available, namely Comfort, Neutral, Sport, Race and Personal (which is a customisable driving mode).

        The gearbox choices are either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 6-speed Efficient Dual Clutch (EDC) gearbox with paddle shifters and launch control (which can be activated by holding both of the shifter paddles).

        The interior features a portrait style infotainment system and red graphical display on the digital tachometer flanked by analogue fuel and water temperature gauges. The infotainment system supports AppleCarPlay and Android Auto. An engine revving sound is played through the speakers when the driver opens the door of the car. Red stitching with RS badges are standard on the interior and the Trophy model adds an Alcantara-suede trim on the steering wheel. Recaro sports seats are optional equipment. Buyers have the choice to have a carbon fibre weave or an Alcantara trim.

        The suspension system has struts up front and a torsion beam at the rear, but its front configuration has new geometry and retains Renault Sport's PerfoHub technology, which reduces kingpin angle offset and resists torque and bump steer. The system uses fluid-filled shock absorbers commonly found on rally cars on the lower end of the suspension struts and is called a damper within a damper system by the manufacturer.

        The entry-level 280 Sport, features a torque-vectoring system of braking the inner wheels during a turn, to further improve turn-in; and a passive double damping suspension system.

        The 280 Cup trim is similar to the 280 Sport trim, but adds a mechanical Torsen limited-slip-differential to the front wheels along with a 10% stiffer suspension setup. 19-inch wheels with Bridgestone tyres and lightweight brakes with aluminium hubs and red calipers are optional.

        The 300 Trophy is similar to the 280 Cup, but has even firmer suspension, a lightweight DESS (Dual-Energy Storage System) battery, a different cylinder head and turbocharger with a higher-performance engine tune for more power (221 kw). Torque figure is increased to 420 NM (400 NM for cars with a manual gearbox).
