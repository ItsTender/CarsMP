    <h2> Mercedes AMG One </h2> <h4>

        The Mercedes-AMG ONE (R50, previously known as Project One) is a limited-production plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by Mercedes-AMG, featuring Formula One-derived technology. The Project One concept car was unveiled at the 2017 International Motor Show Germany by the seven-time F1 world champion and Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 driver, Lewis Hamilton and Head of Mercedes-Benz, Dieter Zetsche.
        Mercedes-AMG unveiled the concept version of the ONE, the Project One with nearly identical specifications to the production version. Claimed that the production ONE will be evaluated on their performance, durability, and ability in Mercedes-Benz's proving grounds and on racing circuits. Development of the AMG ONE took place at Mercedes-AMG GmbH, in Affalterbach Germany. Head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers described that when "the time is right", Lewis Hamilton, who has worked on the development of the car will join the team of development drivers testing prototypes of the car.
        The production version of the AMG ONE unveiled on June 1, 2022. Production was expected to begin in late 2022 and planned to be limited for 275 units at a price of US$2.72 million per unit, all of which had been already sold. Mercedes-AMG received orders more than four times of the planned production number, but they refused to increase the production limit, in order to maintain exclusivity of the car. Production of the AMG ONE began in August 2022, all 275 cars were set to be hand built by Mercedes-AMG, with deliveries to begin in late 2022. The first car was delivered on January 16, 2023, which had an exclusive paint job inspired by the livery of F1 W12 E Performance. Lewis Hamilton reportedly purchased two AMG ONE units, of which one is to be gifted to his father Anthony. Other notable owners of the AMG ONE include; former Mclaren-Mercedes F1 driver David Coulthard, former Mercedes F1 driver and 2016 F1 world champion Nico Rosberg and former Mercedes F1 driver Valtteri Bottas.
        The exterior of the car is designed primarily for better aerodynamics. Notable aerodynamic features include; moveable slats which were specifically developed for the front wheelhouses, two-part extendable rear wing with DRS system and active flaps on the front diffuser which were adjustable to suit the driver chosen driving program. Additionally, large front air inlets, roof-mounted air intake, large aerodynamic fin extending down the back half of the car and aerodynamically optimized wheels to aid generate more downforce in order to carry the maximum speed at highspeed corners. Powertrain The powertrain of the Mercedes-AMG ONE is rated at 782 kW (1,063 PS; 1,049 hp) through a hybrid drivetrain that shares many features with modern F1 cars. The car has five motors with different functions on board: an internal combustion engine and four electric motors.
        The ONE has six different drive modes. Including "Race Safe" mode; which features a hybrid driving mode with an all-electric start up. The ICE is switched at higher speeds. "Race" mode is also a hybrid driving mode with a special charging strategy. Also, with a continuous combustion engine run and battery charging. "EV" mode is an all-electric driving mode. "Race Plus" mode features active aerodynamics; front diffuser flaps folds up to shape, rear wing is fully extended, louvers (front fender vents) opens up, lower the car by 37 mm in front and 30 mm in rear, chassis tuning and special performance management. "Strat 2" mode, which features all "Race Plus" changes and additionally with firmer suspension tuning and full electric power from all electric motors. This is a similar driving mode for those in use in F1 cars during qualifying sessions. The "Individual" mode allows the driver to set the car settings as per their personal preferences. In "Race Plus" and "Strat 2" modes, the total vehicle downforce increase by up to five times when compared to other drive modes. Also, the AMG ONE features F1's DRS. Reducing the vehicle's overall downforce by 20 percent from lowering the rear wing flaps and closing the front louvers to increase straight line speed. DRS can be turned off by manually and automatically from applying brakes. Official standstill acceleration times claimed by Mercedes-AMG, Top speed: 352 km/h (219 mph) 0-100 km/h (62 mph): 2.9 seconds 0-200 km/h (124 mph): 7.0 seconds 0-300 km/h (186 mph): 15.6 seconds
