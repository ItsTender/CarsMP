        <h2> Mercedes AMG One </h2> <h4> 

             The Mercedes-AMG ONE (R50, previously known as Project One) is a limited-production plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by Mercedes-AMG, featuring Formula One-derived technology. The Project One concept car was unveiled at the 2017 International Motor Show Germany by the seven-time F1 world champion and Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 driver, Lewis Hamilton and Head of Mercedes-Benz, Dieter Zetsche.
             Mercedes-AMG unveiled the concept version of the ONE, the Project One with nearly identical specifications to the production version. Claimed that the production ONE will be evaluated on their performance, durability, and ability in Mercedes-Benz's proving grounds and on racing circuits. Development of the AMG ONE took place at Mercedes-AMG GmbH, in Affalterbach Germany. Head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers described that when "the time is right", Lewis Hamilton, who has worked on the development of the car will join the team of development drivers testing prototypes of the car.
                    The production version of the AMG ONE unveiled on June 1, 2022. Production was expected to begin in late 2022 and planned to be limited for 275 units at a price of US$2.72 million per unit, all of which had been already sold. Mercedes-AMG received orders more than four times of the planned production number, but they refused to increase the production limit, in order to maintain exclusivity of the car. Production of the AMG ONE began in August 2022, all 275 cars were set to be hand built by Mercedes-AMG, with deliveries to begin in late 2022. The first car was delivered on January 16, 2023, which had an exclusive paint job inspired by the livery of F1 W12 E Performance.

        <h2> Porsche Carrera GT </h2> <h4>
    The Porsche Carrera GT (Project Code 980) is a mid-engine sports car that was manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche from 2004 to 2006.
    Sports Car International named the Carrera GT number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 2000s, and number eight on its Top Sports Cars of All Time list.
    For its advanced technology and development of its chassis, Popular Science magazine awarded it the "Best of What's New" award in 2003.
    The development of the Carrera GT can be traced back to the 911 GT1 and LMP1-98 racing cars. Due in part to the FIA and ACO rule changes in 1998, both designs had ended.
    Porsche at the time had planned a new Le Mans prototype for the 1999 season.
    The car was initially intended to use a turbocharged flat-six engine, but was later redesigned to use a new V10 engine, pushing the project back to planned completion in 2000. The V10 was a unit secretly built by Porsche for the Footwork Formula One team in 1992, but later shelved. The engine was resurrected for the Le Mans prototype.
    Porsche did keep part of the project alive by using the 5.5 L V10 from the prototype in a concept car called the Carrera GT shown at the 2000 Paris Motor Show.  mainly in an attempt to draw attention to their display, Surprising interest in the vehicle and an influx of revenue provided from the Cayenne helped Porsche decide to produce the car, and development started on a road-legal version that would be produced in small numbers at Porsche's new manufacturing facility in Leipzig. Porsche started a production run of the Carrera GT in 2004. The first Carrera GT went on sale in the United States on 31 January 2004.
    Originally a production run of 1,500 cars was planned.

        <h2> Ferrari SF90 Stradale </h2> <h4>
    The Ferrari SF90 Stradale (Type F173) is a mid-engine PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. The car shares its name with the SF90 Formula One car with SF90 standing for the 90th anniversary of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team and "Stradale" meaning "made for the road".  he SF90 Stradale is equipped with three electric motors, adding a combined output of 220 PS (162 kW; 217 bhp) to a twin-turbocharged V8 engine rated at a power output of 780 PS (574 kW; 769 hp) at 7,500 rpm. The car is rated at a total output of 1,000 PS (735 kW; 986 hp) at 8,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) at 6,000 rpm.
    A 16-inch curved display located behind the steering wheel displays various vital statistics of the car to the driver. The car also employs a new head-up display that would reconfigure itself according to the selected driving mode. The steering wheel is carried over from the F8 but now features multiple capacitive touch interfaces to control the various functions of the car. Other conventional levers and buttons are retained. The interior will also channel sound of the engine to the driver according to the manufacturer.
    Ferrari states that the SF90 Stradale is capable of accelerating from a standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.5 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.7 seconds and can attain a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph). It is the fastest Ferrari road car on their Fiorano Circuit as of 2020, seven tenths of a second faster than the LaFerrari. The Manufacturer also claims that the SF90 Stradale can generate 390 kg (860 lb) of downforce at 250 km/h (155 mph) due to new findings in aero and thermal dynamics.
    The car employs a cab-forward design in order to utilise the new aerodynamic parts of the car more effectively and in order to incorporate radiators or the cooling requirements of the hybrid system of the car. The design is a close collaboration between Ferrari Styling Centre and Ferrari engineers.

        <h2> Chevrolet Corvette ZO6 </h2> <h4>

            The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. The racing version, the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R, also made its debut that same month. Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.
            The Z06 uses a new naturally aspirated 5.5 L V8 producing 670 hp (500 kW; 679 PS) at 8,400 rpm, 460 lb⋅ft (624 N⋅m) of torque at 6,300 rpm and has a redline of 8,600 rpm. This engine, dubbed the LT6, features a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) and a flat-plane crank, and surpasses the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black Series' M159 engine to become the most powerful naturally aspirated production V8. A modified version of this engine has powered the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R since 2019, and many features in the racing engine carry over to the road engine. Other features of this new engine include a cast aluminum block, dual coil valve springs supporting titanium intake & sodium filled exhaust valves, forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, active split intake manifold with twin 87mm throttle bodies, four-into-two-into-one stainless steel exhaust headers, and a factory six-stage 10-quart dry sump oiling system with individual crank bay scavenging. A feature the LT6 shares with other Chevrolet small blocks is the bore spacing of 4.4 inches. The Z06 uses the same 8-speed dual-clutch transmission used by Stingray models, albeit with a shorter 5.56:1 final drive ratio for improved acceleration. Chevrolet claims this allows the Z06 to accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 2.6 seconds. The Z06 features the same basic suspension setup as the Stingray, however the electronic limited-slip differential and magnetic ride adaptive suspension system are now standard for all Z06 trims. The Z07 Performance Package includes the FE7 track-oriented suspension setup.

        <h2> BMW M2 </h2> <h4>
    The BMW M2 is a high-performance version of the BMW 2 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. As the 2 Series replaced the 1 Series coupé and convertible models, the first-generation M2 was marketed as the most basic M Car in the range. The first-generation M2 used the F8x chassis from the M3/M4, code name F87 and featured a more powerful and responsive, turbocharged and slightly modified BMW N55 series engine, while its successors, the M2 Competition and M2 CS, featured a high-performance twin-turbocharged engine developed by BMW M GmbH (S55 engine); improved handling, suspension, and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements; interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" (Motorsport) badging and increased weight. The M2 is unofficially considered as an indirect successor to the BMW 1 Series M Coupé.
    The BMW M2 Competition was introduced at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show and replaced the standard M2 Coupé as a more powerful variant. Production began first in July 2018, delivered early 2019. The M2 Competition uses the BMW M GmbH S55 engine, a high performance variant of the N55 engine, that has been detuned from its application in the F80 M3 and F82 M4. The decision to use the S55 engine was a result of Europe adopting the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure as the official procedure to measure vehicle pollutants, which meant that the standard M2's N55 engine was no longer conformed to European emission standards.

        <h2> Toyota GR Yaris </h2> <h4>

        The Toyota GR Yaris is a performance-oriented variant of the XP210 series Yaris supermini/subcompact hatchback, in a segment commonly called the hot hatch. The vehicle is manufactured by Toyota with assistance from the company's Gazoo Racing (GR) division and being produced to meet World Rally Championship (WRC) homologation rules.
        When the XP210 Yaris hatchback was developed, Toyota decided to only offer it in a five-door bodywork, as three-door hatchbacks had been diminishing in popularity. While the decision made financial sense, it posed a problem for Toyota's WRC team, which felt only a three-door hatch was suitable for competition. Despite the expense of developing a limited-production performance model, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda felt strongly that it was important for the company to still be represented at the WRC, so he authorised the development of the GR Yaris. Toyoda would later say that he saw the GR Yaris as a passion project of his, stemming from a desire for the automaker to develop and build a sports car purely of its own design, unlike the 86 (BRZ) or the GR Supra.
        The GR Yaris was unveiled at the 2020 Tokyo Auto Salon, and is sold in Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Mexico, Argentina and Taiwan. The GR Yaris has not been offered in the United States or Canada, So both regions received the larger, five-door GR Corolla in 2022 for the 2023 model year instead.

        <h2> Renault Megane RS Trophy </h2> <h4>
    The Renault Mégane Renault Sport is a series of high-performance hatchback models based on the Renault Mégane, produced since 2004 by the high-performance subsidiary company Renault Sport for its parent company Alpine, a subsidiary of Renault. The Mégane RS won awards such as "Best hot hatch" from What car? (2010–2014), "Highest placed non-supercar" in Evo's annual Car of the Year test 2011 and "Best hot hatch" from Top Gear. The third generation of the Renault Megane R.S. is based on the 4th generation of the Mégane and was introduced at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is available in 3 trims: 280-Sport, 280-Cup and 300-Trophy. The Mégane R.S. is only available in 5-door hatchback bodystyle and was developed with the assistance of Renault F1 team driver Nico Hulkenberg.
    All feature a similar turbocharged 1.8-litre inline-4 engine (to a varying rate of tune) shared with the Alpine A110, and as standard a four-wheel steering system to improve handling, though this was removed to save weight in the Trophy-R. Five selectable drive-modes are available, namely Comfort, Neutral, Sport, Race and Personal.
    The suspension system has struts up front and a torsion beam at the rear, but its front configuration has new geometry and retains Renault Sport's PerfoHub technology, which reduces kingpin angle offset and resists torque and bump steer. The system uses fluid-filled shock absorbers commonly found on rally cars on the lower end of the suspension struts and is called a damper within a damper system by the manufacturer.
