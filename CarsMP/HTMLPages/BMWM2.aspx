     <h2> BMW M2 </h2> <h4>
         The BMW M2 is a high-performance version of the BMW 2 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH.

         As the 2 Series replaced the 1 Series coupé and convertible models, the first-generation M2 was marketed as the most basic M Car in the range. The first-generation M2 used the F8x chassis from the M3/M4, code name F87 and featured a more powerful and responsive, turbocharged and slightly modified BMW N55 series engine, while its successors, the M2 Competition and M2 CS, featured a high-performance twin-turbocharged engine developed by BMW M GmbH (S55 engine);
         improved handling, suspension, and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements; interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" (Motorsport) badging and increased weight. The M2 is unofficially considered as an indirect successor to the BMW 1 Series M Coupé.
         The M2 was unveiled in Need for Speed in November 2015, before later premiering at the North American International Auto Show in January 2016. Production commenced in October 2015, first delivered early 2016 and the M2 was only available as a rear-wheel drive coupé.
         The M2 is powered by the turbocharged 3.0-litre N55B30T0 straight-six engine rated at 272 kW (365 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 465 N⋅m (343 lb⋅ft) between 1,450 and 4,750 rpm, while an overboost function temporarily increases torque to 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft). The M2 features reinforced pistons, and has lighter aluminium front and rear suspension components resulting in a 5 kg (11 lb) weight reduction. The M2 is available with a 6-speed manual or with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. 0–100 km/h acceleration times are 4.5 seconds manual transmission models and 4.3 seconds for models equipped with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) but could be extended to 270 km/h (168 mph) with the optional M Driver's package. The M2 was used as a safety car in the 2016 MotoGP season.
         The BMW M2 Competition was introduced at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show and replaced the standard M2 Coupé as a more powerful variant. Production began first in July 2018, delivered early 2019. The M2 Competition uses the BMW M GmbH S55 engine, a high performance variant of the N55 engine, that has been detuned from its application in the F80 M3 and F82 M4. The decision to use the S55 engine was a result of Europe adopting the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure as the official procedure to measure vehicle pollutants, which meant that the standard M2's N55 engine was no longer conformed to European emission standards.
         Differences from the N55 engine found in the standard M2, the S55 includes a closed-deck engine block, lightweight crankshaft, different crankshaft bearings, strengthened pistons/rods, different springs/valve material, twin turbos, twin fuel pumps, active exhaust, revised cooling system and intercoolers. The second-generation M2 (G87) was shown to the public ahead of its debut at Motorclassica in Melbourne, Australia, in October 2022. The second-generation M2 wheelbase is 2.1 in (53 mm) longer and overall length is 4.1 in (100 mm) longer and is 1.3 in (33 mm) wider than the first-generation M2.
         The M2 is powered by the twin-turbo 3.0-litre BMW S58 straight-six engine rated at 338 kW (453 hp) at 6,250 rpm and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) between 2,600 and 5,950 rpm. It remains rear-wheel drive and will be available with a 6-speed manual or with an 8-speed automatic transmission. 0–100 km/h acceleration times are 4.3 seconds for manual transmission models and 4.1 seconds for automatic transmission models. Top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) but can be extended to 285 km/h (177 mph) with the optional M Driver's package.
