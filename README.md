this Repository holds my HTML, CSS and JavaScript Web Application, CarsMP; which stands for Cars Master Page, as simple as that because this App works with a .Master page that works as a navigation page and .aspx pages that work with HTML, CSS and C#.

in this App you can Register, Login and Login as Admin all through an SQL Data Base! and also view various Informative pages all about Cars!!

first step after cloning the project is to go to the source repo files of the CarsMP project, then you'll need to put the "roslyn" folder in the "project_name"/CarsMP/bin folder, secondly you'll need to put the "App_Data" folder in the "CarsMP" folder besides the App_Start folder to be exact.

this way the App may be started from VS or VC successfully!!
